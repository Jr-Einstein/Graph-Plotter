# Graph Plotter

A simple program that plots a graph using NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - NumPy: `pip install numpy`
   - Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`

2. Copy and run the following code in your Python environment:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [7, 13, 12, 46]
y = [2, 41, 30, 34]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Graph')
plt.show()
```

3. Execute the code to generate the graph.

**Note:** Make sure you have the required packages (NumPy and Matplotlib) installed in your Python environment.

## Interactive Example

You can also try an interactive version of the Graph Plotter by following these steps:

1. Click the button below to open the interactive environment:

[![Open in CodePen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-CodePen-blue?logo=codepen)](https://codepen.io/pen/?template=ABCD)

2. In the interactive environment, you will see the code provided. You can modify the values of `x` and `y` to plot different graphs by changing the corresponding lists.

3. Click the "Run" button or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Enter) to execute the code and see the graph.

Feel free to experiment with different coordinates and customize the graph's appearance by modifying the code in the interactive environment.
